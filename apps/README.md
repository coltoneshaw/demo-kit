</div>

**Purpose**: Military-style mission planning and tracking with comprehensive status management.

The Mission Operations Plugin is the most sophisticated application, providing end-to-end mission lifecycle management. **This plugin integrates with both the Weather and FlightAware plugins** to provide comprehensive situational awareness during mission planning and execution.

**Key Features**:
- Create missions with callsigns, airports, and crew assignments
- Track mission status (stalled, in-air, completed, cancelled)
- Dedicated mission channels with automatic organization
- Post-mission report forms and crew management
- **Integrated weather and flight data** from other plugins
- Advanced subscription system for status updates

**Integration Dependencies**:
- **Weather Plugin**: Provides weather conditions for departure/arrival airports during mission planning
- **FlightAware Plugin**: Offers flight traffic information to avoid conflicts and optimize routing

**Use Case**: Demonstrates complex workflow management, multi-plugin integration, and advanced Mattermost capabilities. Perfect for showing how multiple services can work together to create comprehensive operational dashboards.

## üîó Plugin Integration Architecture

The three plugins work together to create a comprehensive operational environment:

```
Mission Operations (Core)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weather Plugin (Environmental Data)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FlightAware Plugin (Air Traffic Data)
```

- **Mission Operations** serves as the orchestrator, pulling data from both supporting plugins
- **Weather conditions** inform go/no-go decisions for missions
- **Flight traffic data** helps with routing and timing decisions
- All three plugins support **subscription-based notifications** for real-time updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building All Plugins

```bash
make build-plugins
```

Or build individually:
```bash
cd weather-plugin && make dist
cd flightaware-plugin && make dist
cd missionops-plugin && make dist
```

### Installation

1. Build the desired plugin(s)
2. Upload to Mattermost via **System Console > Plugins**
3. Enable the plugin(s)

**Note**: For full functionality, install all three plugins to demonstrate the complete integration scenario.

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

These plugins are perfect for demonstrating:

- **Basic Integration** (Weather) - Simple commands with mock data
- **External API Integration** (FlightAware) - Real-time data from external services  
- **Complex Workflows** (Mission Ops) - Multi-step processes with plugin dependencies
- **Subscription Systems** - Channel-based notification management
- **Multi-Plugin Architecture** - How plugins can work together seamlessly

Ideal for showcasing Mattermost's enterprise capabilities in defense, logistics, emergency response, and any scenario requiring coordinated operations with real-time data integration.
